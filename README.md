# Baby Incubator Monitor
This project details the development of a sensor-based system designed to simulate a baby incubator.

## Key Features:
- Temprature & Humidity Monitoring: Using DHT11 sensor, we were able to detect the temprature and the Humidity and take the corrective action
- Cooling system: The fan works accroding to the readings coming from the DHT11.
- Display: LCD display is used to display the Temprature and Humidity of the Incubator.

## Prototype Development:
The project utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller as the central processing unit, along with DHT11 sensor, LCD, jumper wires, and a breadboard to create a functional prototype.

## Data Visualization
A software using Python is used to plot the Tempratue and Huimdity in a real time plotting graph.

## Technologies used
- Python
